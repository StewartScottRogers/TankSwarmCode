# Autonomous Loop State

## Last Updated
2026-04-18 — Iteration 1 complete

## Current Iteration
**2** — pending

## Next Hypothesis
Cramped arena (350×250) reduces RedGhost solo carry rate by ≥50% (from 30% to ≤15%) by limiting ECM spoofing effectiveness. If confirmed, Ghost's decisive solos depend on long-range ECM spoofing, not close-quarters play.

## Iteration Log

### Iter 1 — `research/iter-1-redghost-solo-carry`
**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Status:** Partially Confirmed — needs human merge decision

**Hypothesis:** RedGhost carries Red wins via ECM outlasting (timeout), not combat — solo carry rate ≥35% of Red wins, combat rate near 0, All-in role, WinSurv 60–80%.

**Run:** 200 matches, seed 1000, `--on-timeout energy`, default arena (800×600)

**Results:**
- Red 112 (56%) / Blue 88 (44%)
- RedGhost WinSurv: 65/112 = **58%** (baseline 60–80%, just below)
- RedGhost solo carry: 34/112 = **30%** (threshold ≥35% — not met)
- RedGhost Rate/100t: **2.16** (near 0 — confirmed)
- RedGhost solo breakdown: **25 decisive + 9 timeout** (74% decisive)
- RedGhost loss-survivals: **5** (not All-in)

**Confirmed:** MVP role, ECM role, near-zero combat rate
**Refuted:** "Via timeout outlasting" claim; "All-in" claim from prior baseline
**New finding:** Ghost wins decisive solos at near-zero damage → Blue self-eliminates via ECM spoofing misdirection

**Baseline corrections:**
- Prior baseline claimed solo carry 35–50% via timeout → actual is 30% with majority decisive
- Prior baseline claimed All-in → actual has 5 loss-survivals

**BlueEcm note:** BlueEcm is Blue's MVP (53/88 WinSurv = 60%), using burnthrough + jam. Blue is 8% below parity (44%).
